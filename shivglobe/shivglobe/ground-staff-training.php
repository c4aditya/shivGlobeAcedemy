                        The main objective of this course is to prepare students for the crucial role of ground 
                        staff in domestic and international airports. At ShivGlobe Academy, we focus not only on 
                        technical knowledge like check-in procedures, baggage handling, and security protocols,

                        real-life scenarios, our students gain the confidence and skills required to handle airport 
                        operations professionally from day one.
