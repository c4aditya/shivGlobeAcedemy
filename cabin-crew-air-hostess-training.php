                        The main objective of this course is to prepare students for the challenging yet rewarding role
                        of a cabin crew professional. At ShivGlobe Academy, we focus not only on technical aspects such
                        as safety procedures and in-flight operations, but also on grooming, etiquette, and
                        communication. Our program bridges the gap between theoretical learning and practical
                        application through real-life simulations and interactive sessions, ensuring students are
                        industry-ready from day one.
