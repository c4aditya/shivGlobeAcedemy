                        The PHP, Python, and Java Basics program at ShivGlobe Academy Private Limited is designed
                        for students who want to start their journey in software development. This program covers
                        three of the most widely used programming languages in the IT industry, providing students
                        with a strong foundation for web development, application development, and problem-solving.

                    <p class="color-dark">
                        The training ensures that every student develops logical thinking, coding confidence, and
                        the ability to write clean and efficient programs. Through practical exercises, students
                        learn the fundamentals of programming that are essential for both front-end and back-end
                        development careers.

                        The main objective of this course is to introduce students to the core concepts of
                        programming using PHP, Python, and Java. At ShivGlobe Academy, we focus on variables,
                        loops, conditional statements, functions, and object-oriented concepts. Our program bridges
                        the gap between theoretical learning and practical application through coding labs and
                        mini-projects, ensuring students are industry-ready for IT opportunities.
